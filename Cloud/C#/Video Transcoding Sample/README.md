Video Transcoding Sample (FfmpegSample)
=======================================

A simple, minimal example of embarrassingly parallel processing in
the cloud.  This sample defines a job type (FfmpegSample) which
transcodes all its input files in parallel using ffmpeg.

To run this sample in the SDK Test Host, download the ffmpeg binary
into the Vhd folder, then drag the Vhd folder to the VHD box in the
SDK Test Host.  You can download the ffmpeg binary from:

https://greenbutton.blob.core.windows.net/downloads/developer/ffmpeg.exe

To run this sample in GreenButton Cloud Fabric, download the
pregenerated FfmpegSample VHD (Virtual Hard Disk) file and copy it
to your Cloud Fabric installation's clouddrives blob container.
