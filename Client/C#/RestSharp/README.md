RestSharp Video Transcoding Client
==================================

This sample provides a minimal demonstration of invoking the GreenButton
management Web service (REST API) using the RestSharp client library
(http://restsharp.org/, https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp).

It performs the following tasks:

* Upload files to the cloud
* Submit a job to process those files
* Monitor the progress of the job
* Download the results of processing

You can get RestSharp from NuGet.
